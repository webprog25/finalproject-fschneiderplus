| Overall page structure written in HTML (not dynamically generated)        | 5          | 5              | `index.html` provides a static structure.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Page layout defined in CSS                                                | 5          | 5              | `styles.css` is present<br /><br />                                                                                                                                                             |
| Uses CSS classes and ids                                                  | 5          | 3              | Mainly, classes were used, even if a container is present only once                                                                                                                             |
| Uses Flexbox, font and text styling, and the box model                    | 5          | 5              | `styles.css` makes use of flex, other concepts are present, some rules look like copied from somewhere!?                                                                                        |
| **Frontend JavaScript**                                                   |            |                |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Add event handlers to support user interaction                            | 10         | 10             | `done in WeatherApp`: you used arrow functions, thus no context binding is required.                                                                                                            |
| Create, modify, or remove DOM elements                                    | 10         | 7              | DOM manipulation is present in`app.js` Some parts use textContent, but the popup content is poulated by returning html. This is not good.                                                       |
| Use classes and modules to organize frontend code (at least two classes)  | 10         | 8              | `app.js` inludes WeatherApp and WeatherMap as classes, and is imported as module in index.html. Thus, no DomConentLoaded Event is required and JS could have been included in the head section. |
| Use fetch to access your backend                                          | 10         | 10             | `app.js` uses `fetch()` to communicate with backend endpoints. (DELETE and POST)                                                                                                                |
| **Backend JavaScript**                                                    |            |                |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Written in Node and Express                                               | 10         | 10             | Express is used in`server.js` and `api/index.js`.                                                                                                                                               |
| Defines multiple routes, including one GET and one non-GET route          | 10         | 5              | `api/index.js` defines GET routes                                                                                                                                                               |
| Uses a route parameter                                                    | 5          | 5              | Route parameters (e.g.,`/api/weather/:stationId`) are used in `api/index.js`.                                                                                                                   |
| Reads a JSON request body and returns results in JSON                     | 10         | 10             | Uses`express.json()` middleware and responds with JSON.                                                                                                                                         |
| Uses a MongoDB database (or another like Sqlite) to store persistent data | 10         | 7              | Persistent storage is implemented using MongoDB. Cannot be tested as init_db.mongodb is empty                                                                                                   |

## Notes:

- Schönes Projekt und gut umgesetzt. Ein paar Abzüge weil Dinge gefehlt haben, oder von der Umsetzung her nicht ganz wie gefordert waren.
